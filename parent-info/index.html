The Club is for every level rider from beginner to seasoned rider.</p><p>Why cycling? Cycling is a family-friendly fitness activity that can be done lifelong, with great social qualities. Groups of cyclists (except when climbing difficult hills) can talk, joke, and some even sing as they ride. Enthusiasm for cycling as an alternative sport and healthy lifestyle is at an all-time high. </p><p>Training and racing with a team provides life lessons in self-discipline, teamwork and sportsmanship, along with the fitness and camaraderie. Some sports tend to favor certain body types. Cycling is different. The bicycle is an equalizer, showing little favor to any particular body type by adapting to each rider with correct frame sizing, adjustment of seat height and stem length. Since good “bike-fit” is important, be sure to consult with me before purchasing a new or used bike! </p><p><b></b></p><p><b> Is Participating Dangerous? </b>Are you new to mountain biking? Forget what you have seen on TV with the X-Games or soft drink commercials. In cross-country bike races, the average speed is usually around ten to twelve miles per hour. This is an endurance sport where the fittest athletes win. Each year, the League collects data on injuries from every team. Typically, for the whole League combined, there will be one or two broken bones, some sprains, a few cuts, some bruises, lots of nicks and scrapes, but little else. Statistically, we suffer fewer serious injuries than most other mainstream sports, especially contact sports.</p><p>We do our best to minimize the risks to your athlete. Certain risky behaviors are discouraged or forbidden, the League helmet rule is strictly enforced and we teach each athlete bike-control skills early in the season to minimize the risk of crashing. After all, if you crash you not only risk injury but also lose valuable time during races. Even with our best efforts, crashes and injuries can occur. Bellefonte MTB Club does require all athletes comply with certain athletic eligibility rules, including that the athlete have personal medical insurance. The team also carries additional insurance through NICA that supplements your personal policy. </p><p>We do our best to provide many parent/coaches as ride leaders, each equipped with a first aid kit and cell phone on every ride, one adult for each group if we split the team. Occasionally, circumstances arise where this is not possible. In this instance, we may designate and equip a student/athlete who we believe is adequately mature, responsible and capable in the ride leader role. </p><p><b>How We Build Our Team and Train:</b>We don’t have tryouts. If you try, and keep trying, you're on our team. With training from the League, we will work to create capable and confident riders out of timid, out-of-shape beginners, year after year. Athletes who are already in good condition (like cross-country runners) adapt quickly and do very well.</p><p>We value and promote excellence, believing that ordinary athletes can attain big results through setting goals, mapping a strategy, and giving the task disciplined effort.</p><p>The training scheme is a carefully planned schedule of training rides that gradually increase in distance and difficulty. The time-frame must be long to insure that the athlete progresses at a rate gradual enough to avoid injury, and long enough to achieve peak fitness by season’s end and the championship final race. The “gradualism” based training scheme cannot be artificially compressed into the normal sports season time-frame without diminishing its effectiveness. </p><p>The training is choreographed in three basic phases so that everyone is adequately prepared once the racing begins. The first is the “Base” or endurance phase where we ride at low speeds, teach handling skills (for safety) and gradually increase the ride duration to build a solid foundation of cardiovascular fitness. The second is the “Build” phase to add strength and power by increasing the amount of hill climbing. The last is the “Peak” phase where we add fast-paced race simulation. </p><p>Once the actual riding starts, depending on team size, we will split the team workouts into fitness-based groups since our goal is to challenge but not overwhelm each rider. All groups do a similar type of ride, albeit at different paces. We do our best to design a training scheme for each rider appropriate for his/her level of experience, fitness, and personal ambitions. Groups are coed where practical. </p><p>Practice will not take place each weekday like some sports. Accordingly, we do our most essential training ride on Sunday morning at 10:00 am (subject to change). This allows time for morning breakfast, family time, and homework in the evening. Combined with one shorter weekday workout/practice, including core body strengthening, yoga, running, spin, and rides during the week, this schedule is designed get us fit in a time-efficient way, minimize time on the bike, avoid injury, fatigue, and mental burnout. </p><p>Athlete will need to continually monitor his/her own fatigue level and discuss it with the coaches. Rest and recovery are a critical part of any training plan. It is important that your athlete avoids the temptation to do extra workouts beyond what is recommended. </p><p><b>Bike Racing is Girl-Friendly</b><b>:</b> There are lots of girls racing in the League. In fact, girl participation is the fastest growing demographic.</p><p>In the 1992 classic movie “A League of Their Own” Tom Hanks (as coach Jimmy Dugan) exclaims with surprise and dismay: “There’s no crying in baseball!” echoing the old-school world-view from the no-pain, no gain masculine perspective. In fact, there is too crying in cycling, also pre-race makeup, hair, nails, and other surprises! The captain of the elite women’s VeloBella cycling team explained: “We girls sometimes cry. It’s not because we’re sad, it’s an emotional release. We might cry when the training is hard and we’re struggling a little, or during a stressful race, and we definitely might cry when we win. It’s ok! Don’t feel bad about it like you’ve done something to upset us. We want to be here (training and racing) and yes, we also like to feel pretty on race-day.” We haven’t said any of this to frighten you or indicate that our girls will be doing lots of crying…they won’t be; but rather to make the point that the League and our own Bellefonte team culture is truly co-ed, and we will work hard to provide an experience that encourages and celebrates girls’ different needs and tastes. </p><p><b>What to Eat:</b> Athletes are expected to be informed and responsible with their eating habits. While this is not a weight-loss program, fat loss and increased lean muscle-mass are typical results of training you should expect. Your athlete will need more high quality calories from complex carbohydrates and will also need more protein than is required for a non-exercising lifestyle. An inadequate or junk food diet will put your athlete at a disadvantage against those who are eating to win. Do not use any of the popular “high this, low that” fad-of-the-month diets. Nutrition will be discussed more as the season progresses.</p><p><b>Parents and Others Ride Along:</b> Training for bike racing is hard work. Fortunately, it’s also a lot of fun and the team sometimes end rides with social time. Road trips to the races (camping if weather allows) are the best of all. You will discover that the other teams in the League are full of delightful kids, with encouraging coaches and wonderfully supportive parents. At the races, the whole gallery of spectators cheers and rings cowbells not just for their own kids, but yours too! This is a very friendly sport. </p><p><b>How Communication Happens:</b> We have a public Facebook page that is available for general updates and events. We will use email for most communication with parents and athletes. We will also be using the apps Reminder and Signup Genius for race weekend. For those of you with Facebook, we will have a private page for parents and athletes, posts and updates will discuss training schedules, offer feedback about rides completed, include team news, tips, motivation and encouragement, recognition, strategic planning for races, travel planning, unrelated fun tidbits, bike culture and more. Please check your email daily and the team page periodically!</p><p><b>About Commitment</b><b>:</b> If your athlete regularly misses workouts, especially the Sunday rides; he/she will not progress at the same rate as fellow athletes. I guarantee that this will become a source of frustration for your student once they start having difficulty keeping up and will send a clear signal to others that they are not committed to the team. </p><p>We promise to treat your athlete like a responsible young adult. Accordingly, we will interpret a habit of missed practices and a pattern of disinterest as a signal to be dropped from the team. If your athlete is unable to attend any of the agreed-upon practice rides because of school homework, job schedules, family commitments or other concerns, it is really important that they consult with me so we can create an alternate plan to keep the season on track. </p><p>3 unexcused absences will result in a rider being removed from the team.</p><p>Some athletes may want to try and do two sports at once. We recognize that our long training time-frame may create an unavoidable overlap for part of the season. This is ok. We believe however, that once the season really gets going that trying to do two sports at once is a recipe for frustration and failure at both, may lead to exhaustion and sickness, and can impact academic performance. We discourage this idea. </p><p>The club is a race team and, as such, each participant is required to try at least one race. If, after this experience, the rider determines that he/she is not into racing, then they are not forced to continue racing. However, this is strongly discouraged and students who join the team must be open to experience racing. </p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Code of Conduct</b><b>:</b> We are committed to safety. We think about safety, teach safety and require each rider to always ride in a safe and controlled manner. Riders who repeatedly flaunt our safety rules or engage in behaviors that present unnecessary risk to themselves or others will be dropped from the program. As visible representatives of the Bellefonte MTB Club and ambassadors of cycling, athletes are expected to conduct themselves in a manner consistent with that status and follow the Bellefonte MTB rules of behavior at all times.</p><p>If a team member is seen riding without a helmet at any time during the season, the rider will be removed from the team – no excuses.</p><p><b>Community Service:</b> As part of being on the team, members are required to undertake eight hours of community service during the season. Service can be done with a local organization or by assisting with team and Pennsylvania League activities. As part of the teams mission to create stewards of the land and respecting the public spaces available for us to enjoy, we will be arranging local park clean ups and local trail maintenance days throughout the season. Athletes may also participate in Teen Trail Corps., through IMBA, which has a partnership with NICA. Most High School students need to do community service as a graduation requirement, so these will serve as opportunities to our Athletes. </p><p><b>About Academics:</b> The goal for Bellefonte MTB Club is to help develop our athletes academically, physically and socially into mature young adults. To qualify to participate in Bellefonte MTB Club, each athlete must be achieving academically in a manner satisfactory to wishes of his/her parents and the standards of the school. </p><p>Failure to maintain satisfactory academics during the cycling season is grounds to be dropped from the team.</p><p><b>You’ll Need Some Equipment</b><b>:</b> Your athlete will need an appropriate bike, cycling clothing and other items. Please consult with me before you buy anything so I can help you get the right gear and minimize the cost. Bicycles and helmets must be inspected and approved for function and safety, then re-inspected at regular intervals. </p><p>Getting all the equipment can be challenging. Prices vary widely and much is available both new and used on the internet at discount prices. Let me help you find what you need. </p><p><b>Cost of Participating</b><b>: </b> Riders must pay for NICA Association registration ($25), Pennsylvania League registration ($40), entry fees to each of the five races and travel costs (each race can cost up to $40) and a Race Kit for the season (~$100). In addition, the team requires dues of $100 to cover the cost of insurance, coaching stipends, and incidental costs. Payment of dues can be spread over the season. The team does fundraising to offset many of these costs and scholarships are provided to those who need it. No student will be denied participation due to a lack of resources.</p><p><b>Team Sponsorship:</b> Local bike shops, other cycling teams, and companies in the cycling industry may be sponsoring the team. </p><p>As part of our sponsorship, currently, riders are able to purchase parts and gear from The Bicycle Shop at a discount (please contact the coach for this information). Occasionally, other offers may become available and they will be relayed to the team.</p><p>We do all that we can to raise money to help reduce the cost of any and all items and hope to offer the full clothing kit to students for no more than $100 this season. The final price depends on how much we are able to raise through sponsorship and fundraising. </p><p><b>Assistant Coaches and Team Officers: </b> Every year, for the kids to be successful we need lots of help from team parents and volunteers. Some help with transportation and other things, some act in the capacity of helper-coaches. I am also looking for parents who would like to be trained as assistant coaches and ride leaders. You do not have to be a talented rider or racer to function effectively in this role, you learn as you go, and it’s a lot of fun!</p><p><b></b></p><p>Please be sure to let me know if you have any questions. </p><p><b></b></p><p>Sincerely, </p><p><b></b></p><p>Coach Courtney</p><p><a href="mailto:BellefonteMTBClub@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BellefonteMTBClub@gmail.com</a> </p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BellefonteMTB/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">facebook.com/BellefonteMTB</a></p><p><b></b></p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="21"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="23"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="24"><span data-reactid="25"><!-- react-empty: 26 --><h2 data-reactid="27"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="28">Parent Info</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="30"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="31"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
